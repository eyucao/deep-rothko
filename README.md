makes rothko color field paintings


# dev notes

- Rothko's color fields start appearing around 1947.
- Have to filter out all non color fields(including formative works that lead to color fields)
- Around 1950 onwards, all paintings are only color fields.
- A lot of missing data.
- Year labels might be interesting.
- 1964 is predominanty black color fields, why?
